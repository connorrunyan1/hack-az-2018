##Hack for Hack Arizona 2018

## Description
Python Script to run on a RaspberryPi with an integrated camera.  The image
will be interpreted using AWS Image Recognition, and then spoken aloud via 
AWS Polly.  The goal is to allow sight-challenged individuals to get unassisted
descriptions of scenes around them, enabling greater personal independence.
